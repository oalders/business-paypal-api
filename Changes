0.70 2012-11-13
    - First OALDERS release
    - Fixes RT #70424 (Syntax deprecated in perl v5.14)

0.68 2010-03-12
    - First hembreed release
    - I've moved the module's scm to
      http://github.com/hembreed/Business-PayPal-API so others
      may share my pain. CPAN will be updated from there.

    - API.pm
       1. Changed eq 'Success' to =~ /Success/ to accomodate variations
          introduced by PayPal.
       2. Changed test for duplicates to test for defined variable first.
          This was causing errors in 5.10+ perl versions.
    - t/*t Changed test for Success in all test modules as above
    - t/RecurringPayments Corrected errors in type definitions and testing.
      Needs more work.
    - TransactionSearch Corrected test instructions and code to
      allow transaction searches using the transactionID.
      This works for some types of transactions but not others as per PayPal.
      It is the only way to get MassPayment information.

0.62 2009-07-28
    - last SCOTTW release
    - getFields() returns an array ref if multiple values are returned
      from PayPal, otherwise it behaves as it always did, returning a
      non-ref scalar.
    - BillingAgreement information returned in ExpressCheckout
    - Fix GetTransactionDetails 'PII_SalesTax' parameter
    - Fix GetTransactionDetails to return multiple PaymentItems
    - Fix MassPay to use the correct UniqueID parameter
    - Add DoReferenceTransaction to RecurringPayments API
    - Lots of credit given to great folks with patches in API docs

    - Thanks everyone! I'm handing this module off to Danny Hembree for
      maintenance now.

0.33 2006-07-05
    - fix documentation regarding SetExpressCheckout (returns a hash, not
      a scalar). If you were following the code in the SYNOPSIS for
      ExpressCheckout and getting a token with '3/8' or '4/8', you should
      change the $token to %response, since SetExpressCheckout() returns a
      hash (big thanks to Andy Spiegl for finding this).
